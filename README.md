# Neper2Abaqus
## Main Function
Create a microstructure using Neper, with the output of the microstructure format as an Abaqus input file and update the Abaqus input file to include materials and sections for each generated grain
## Creating Microstruture with Neper
Included here is an example shell file which can be used to create a synthetic microstructre in Neper with the following features:
* a unit volume RVE with 300 grains.
* assigned angles defined by euler angles
### Extracting information output from Neper
The grain information can be extracted from the file '.tess' generated by Neper.
The important information to use here are:
* orientation (found at the location in the file marked with 'ori')
* grain centroid in x,y,z (found at the location in the file marked with 'seed' using the 2nd-4th columns)

The volume for each grain is found in the file with extension '.stelset'

Once this information is extracted, it all should be added to the corresponding sheets in the excel file included here named 'input_file_info'

## Material parameters
The material parameters required should also be added to the corresponding sheet in the excel file named 'input_file_info'.  The parameters from ** are based on the order found in the pdf file found [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jk2079/Kysar_Research_Laboratory/Single_Crystal_UMAT.html)
